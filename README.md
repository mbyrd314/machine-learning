# machine-learning
Simple machine learning experiments

The first is an attempted implementation of the DCGAN architecture. Currently, it is obviously unfinished. I will also
have to play around with the stride lengths and kernel sizes because the paper does not specify these and the implementations
I have seen do not all use the same values.
